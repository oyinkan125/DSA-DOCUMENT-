We were thought how to make use of Excel, Power Bi and now to my portfolio building

## Project Topic: Amazon case study

   - Data collection.
   - Data manipulation.

MS power point (for presentation).

Data cleaning and Preparation 
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we do the following action;
 - Data loading and inspection.
 - Handling missing variable.
 -  Data cleaning and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;

 - What is the average discount percentage by product category?
 - How many products are listed under each category?
 - What is the total number of reviews per category?
 - Which products have the highest average ratings?
 - What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
 - Which products have the highest number of reviews?

   ### Data Analysis
   This is where we used MS Excel function for cleaning and also to create pivot table to summarize our table given to us
   - MAX FUNCTION to get the highest average rating

     
     



## Project 2: Palmoria group HR Analysis
The data analysis aims to generate an insight in Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, which is  embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.


Tools used:

- Power Bi for analyzing and reporting[Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
- MS Power point for presentation.

Data cleaning and Preparation 

In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we do the following action;
